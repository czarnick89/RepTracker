- Exercises have many Sets  

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/RepTrack.git
```
## Backend Setup
2. Navigate to the backend directory:  
```
cd RepTracker/backend
```
3. Create a virtual environment:  
```
python -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment:  
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  
- Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Apply database migrations:  
```
python manage.py migrate
```
7. Create a superuser:  
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
8. Run the development server:  
```
python manage.py runserver
```
## Frontend Setup
9. Navigate to the frontend directory:  
```
cd RepTracker/frontend
```
10. Install dependencies:  
```
npm install
```
11. Run the development server:  
```
npm run dev
```
12. Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Testing

### Backend Tests
Run backend tests with coverage:
```
cd backend
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=90
```

### Frontend E2E Tests
Run Playwright end-to-end tests:
```
cd frontend
npm test
```

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… User authentication (login, register, logout)
- âœ… Form validation and error handling
- âœ… Navigation and routing
- âœ… Dashboard functionality
- âœ… Responsive design across browsers
- âœ… 55+ automated tests with CI integration

### CI/CD Testing
- **Parallel execution** of backend and frontend tests
- **Dependency caching** for faster builds (pip, npm, Playwright browsers)
- **Automated testing** on every push to main branch
- **Security scanning** with OWASP ZAP

## CI/CD Pipeline

RepTracker uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment:

### Pipeline Features
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Backend and frontend tests run simultaneously
- **Dependency Caching**: 
  - Python packages (pip)
  - Node.js packages (npm)
  - Playwright browser binaries
- **Security Audits**: Automated OWASP ZAP scanning
- **Production Deployment**: Automated AWS deployment on successful tests

### Build Optimization
- **Cache Hit Rates**: 50-60% faster CI runs with dependency caching
- **Sequential Local Testing**: Prevents test interference in development
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed test output for debugging

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push to main**: Full CI/CD pipeline (test + deploy)
- **Pull Requests**: Test-only pipeline for code review

## Deployment

### Production Environment
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS EC2
- **Security**: HTTPS with SSL certificates, security groups, SSH key-based access
- **Monitoring**: Automated deployment scripts with error handling

### Deployment Process
1. **Automated Testing**: All tests pass in CI
2. **SSH Connection**: Secure connection to production server
3. **Code Deployment**: Pull latest changes and restart services
4. **Database Migrations**: Automatic Django migrations
5. **Health Checks**: Verify application is running correctly

### Security Features
- **OWASP ZAP Audits**: Regular security vulnerability scanning
- **HTTP-only Cookies**: Secure JWT token storage
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data not committed to repository
- **Firewall Rules**: Restricted access with AWS security groups
